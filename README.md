# ProfileView.jl

This package contains tools for visualizing profiling data collected
with [Julia's][Julia] built-in sampling
[profiler](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/profile/). It
can be helpful for geting a big-picture overview of the major
bottlenecks in your code, and optionally highlights lines that trigger
garbage collection as potential candidates for optimization.

This type of plot is known as a [flame
graph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph).

## Installation

Within Julia, use the package manager:
```julia
Pkg.add("ProfileView")
```

## Usage and visual interpretation

To demonstrate ProfileView, first we have to collect some profiling
data. Here's a simple test function for demonstration:

```julia
function profile_test(n)
    for i = 1:n
        A = randn(100,100,20)
        m = maximum(A)
        Afft = fft(A)
        Am = mapslices(sum, A, 2)
        B = A[:,:,5]
        Bsort = mapslices(sort, B, 1)
        b = rand(100)
        C = B.*b
    end
end

profile_test(1)  # run once to trigger compilation
Profile.clear()  # in case we have any previous profiling data
@profile profile_test(10)
```
Now that we have profiling data, visualizing it is a simple matter:
```
julia> using ProfileView

julia> ProfileView.view()
```
If you're following along, you should see something like this:

This plot is a visual representation of the *call graph* of the code that you just profiled. The "root" of the tree is at the bottom; if you move your mouse over the long horizontal purple bar at the bottom, you'll see it's `_start` in `client.jl`. As is explained [elsewhere](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/profile/), this is the first Julia function called in launching the REPL. If you move your mouse upwards, you'll see the nest of functions called by `_start`, including `run_repl`, `eval_user_input`, etc.

While the vertical axis therefore represents nesting depth, the
horizontal axis represents the amount of time (more precisely, the
number of backtraces) spent at each line.  One sees on the 6th line
from the bottom, there are several differently-colored bars, each
corresponding to a different line of `profile_test`. The fact that
they are all positioned on top of the lower purple bar means that all
of these lines are called by the same "parent" function. Within a
block of code, they are sorted in order of increasing line number, to
make it easier for you to compare to the source code.

From this visual representation, we can very quickly learn several
things about this function:

- The most deeply-nested line corresponds to `mapslices(sort, B, 1)`,
  resulting in the tall "stack" of bars on the right edge. However,
  this call does not take much time, because these bars are narrow
  horizontally.

- In contrast, the two most time-consuming operations are the calls to
  `fft` and `mapslices(sum, A, 2)`. (This is more time-consuming than
  the `mapslices(sort,...)` simply because it has to process more
  data.)

- In this plot, red is a special color: it is reserved for function
  calls that trigger *garbage collection*, a time-consuming process
  that often serves as a bottleneck.  Here one could see an example of
  garbage-collection occuring inside `fftw.jl's fft()`, `fftw.jl's
  Plan()`, and in the line `B = A[:,:,5]`.

- You may notice some very narrow bars along the bottom at the left
  edge of this plot. If you hover over them, you'll see that these
  correspond to operations that are performed by your code, but whose
  "parents" are not known.  These are the highly-offensive (well, to
  the author) [truncated
  backtraces](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/3469). Whistle
  a happy tune and pretend they aren't there (although of course they,
  like all other operations, contribute to the total run-time of your
  code).

Further discussion of the proper interpretation of the red bars can be
found [below](#gcdetails).

## GUI features

- Right-clicking on a bar will cause information about this line to be
  printed in the REPL. This can be a convenient way to "mark" lines
  for later investigation.

- Click-drag lets you zoom in on a specific region of the
  image. Double-click to restore the full view.

## Command-line options

The `view` command has the following syntax:
```
function view(data = Profile.fetch(); C = false, colorgc = true, fontsize = 12, combine = true)
```
Here is the meaning of the different arguments:

- The first is the vector containing backtraces. You can use `data1 =
  copy(Profile.fetch()); Profile.clear()` to store and examine results
  from multiple profile runs simultaneously.

- `C` is a flag controlling whether lines corresponding to C and Fortran
  code are displayed. (Internally, ProfileView uses the information
  from C backtraces to learn about garbage-collection and to
  disambiguate the call graph).

- `colorgc`, when `true`, causes lines triggering garbage-collection
  to be displayed in red.

- `fontsize` controls the size of the font displayed as a tooltip.

- `combine` is explained [elsewhere](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/profile/).

### Important points about garbage-collection

You should expect the width and placement of the red bars to vary
from one profile to the next, because garbage-collection is an
infrequent event and therefore highly variable.

Lines triggering garbage-collection are often fruitful targets for
optimization. However, note that red bars indicate
*garbage-collection*, not *allocation*, and in reality it's the latter
that is usually the true source of trouble.  It's quite possible to
have a large allocation that procedes without garbage collection (and
therefore doesn't take much time), only to be followed by a tiny
allocation that triggers garbage collection but which cannot itself be
profitably optimized. Your best way to avoid being fooled is to
collect quite a lot of profiling data (i.e., run your code for
longer), so that all operations allocating memory will likely trigger
a garbage-collection at some point.
